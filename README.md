# python-microsoft-project-prague-sdk
Python port of Microsoft's project Prague's SDK

# Overview

This repository contains python code samples demonstrating how to use the [Project Prague](https://aka.ms/gestures) hand gestures SDK. For a quick introduction to programming with our SDK, please visit our [overview page on docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gestures/). In order to build and run the code samples provided in this repository, you must first [set up Project Prague on your machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gestures/index#getting-started-with-project-prague). Note that you will need an [**Intel® RealSense™ SR300 camera**](https://click.intel.com/intelrealsense-developer-kit-featuring-sr300.html) to enable our gesture detection runtime.
